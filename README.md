# Layerwindow for Cplusplus in windows systems


    At that time, layerWindows was a novelty, just like the Gaussian effect of windows. 
    The code in 2003 is in memory of UI programming under windows OS in those years. 

    did u remeber yahoo widget and windows system desktop widget?  :)

    It â€™s interesting. hummmm?
