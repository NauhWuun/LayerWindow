# WuManBer for Java

Wu/Manber is a very high performance string/text search/match algorithm.

Wu-Manber stand on the shoulders of their Multi Pattern Search predecessors: Aho and Corasick (with a linear time scanner based upon an automata approach), Commentz-Walter (who combined Aho-Corasick with the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm), and Baeza-Yates (with a slightly different combination of Aho-Corasick and Boyer-Moore-Horspool).
